# Wiktionary ebook reader dictionaries:

This repo contains dictionaries extracted from Wiktionary, using kaikki.org/Wiktextract data and my [ebook dictionary creator library](https://github.com/Vuizur/ebook_dictionary_creator).

For each language, it supports 3 formats: Tabfile, Stardict and Kindle.

Please report bugs. Pull requests for my library extracting them are also welcome (because editing stuff for languages you don't speak is difficult).
