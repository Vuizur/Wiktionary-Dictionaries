# Wiktionary ebook reader dictionaries:

This repo contains dictionaries extracted from Wiktionary, using kaikki.org/Wiktextract data and my [ebook dictionary creator library](https://github.com/Vuizur/ebook_dictionary_creator).

For each language, it supports 3 formats: Tabfile, Stardict and Kindle.

The license is the same as Wiktionary: Dual-licensed to the public under both the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA) and the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)

Please report bugs if you find them. Pull requests for my library extracting the dictionary are also welcome, because editing stuff for languages you don't speak is difficult.
